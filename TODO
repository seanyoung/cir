- Sending multiple keys/files
- ir encode/send needs to read xml file
- send from keymap
- Formatting of ir receive is poor/broken
- wasmtime bpf backend
- Generate bpf decoder
- Test all keymaps
- Need ir-ctl and ir-keytable command line parsing
- localization of cli messages
- scancode <=> irp mapping
- lircd.conf generate -> send to lircd -> correct result?

irp parameter keymap

	[[protocols]]
	name = "streamzap"
	protocol = "StreamZap"
	[[protocols.parameter]]
	keycode = 'KEY_1'
	parameter = [ "D=2", "F=5" ]

irp language oddities

sony8: no repeat. Does this protocol not allow repeats?

DirecTV_3FG irp:{38k,600,msb}<1,-1|1,-2|2,-1|2,-2>(10,-2,(D:4,F:8,C:4,1,-30m,5,-2)*){C=7*(F:2:6)+5*(F:2:4)+3*(F:2:2)+(F:2)}[D:0..15,F:0..255]

encode with repeats: 0 -> not valid
decoder cannot generate down event with just non-repeating part, this would
not define D/F/C. So, decoder has to look at down part, see if it does not
define all required vars, and if not, add one iteration of repeat to
down decoder: very messy.
