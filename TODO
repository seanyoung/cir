- ir encode/send needs to read xml file
- Need ir-ctl and ir-keytable command line parsing
- localization of cli messages
- test all the protocols
- calculate maximum length for timeout
- calculate minimum $extent for avoiding runtime calcs
- lead in gap (or whatever irptransmogrifier calls it)
- Formatting of ir receive is poor/broken
- Test all keymaps
- lircd.conf generate -> send to lircd -> correct result?
- DFA edges can be overlapping - removing overlapping parts
- rc_mapping() kfunc
- cir decode irp should read IrpProtocols.xml
- cir decode keymap should support keymap.toml
- access to io_error in aya
- parse of keymap.toml should ensure that raw codes have trailing spaces
  -> remove Message.extend() hack
- cir transmit rawir -S sony15:12 -r 2 ??

irp language oddities

sony8: no repeat. Does this protocol not allow repeats?

DirecTV_3FG irp:{38k,600,msb}<1,-1|1,-2|2,-1|2,-2>(10,-2,(D:4,F:8,C:4,1,-30m,5,-2)*){C=7*(F:2:6)+5*(F:2:4)+3*(F:2:2)+(F:2)}[D:0..15,F:0..255]

encode with repeats: 0 -> not valid
decoder cannot generate down event with just non-repeating part, this would
not define D/F/C. So, decoder has to look at down part, see if it does not
define all required vars, and if not, add one iteration of repeat to
down decoder: very messy.

ENCODING ISSUES:
 - toggle_bit_mask not used when popcount > 1

DECODING ISSUES:
 - toggle_bit_mask with more than 1 bit not supported
 - pcmak leading gap not decoded
