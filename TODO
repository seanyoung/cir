Necessary:
- test all the protocols
- calculate maximum length for timeout
- calculate minimum $extent for avoiding runtime calcs
- lead in gap (or whatever irptransmogrifier calls it)
- Formatting of ir receive is poor/broken
- DFA edges can be overlapping - removing overlapping parts
- keymap needs aeps/eps/ignore_mask/gap?
- lircd decoding toggle_bit_mask with more than 1 bit not supported
- keymap with rc5 protocol should have correct names for BPF programs
  correct protocol numbers

Nice to have:
- ir encode/send needs to read xml file
- cir decode irp should read IrpProtocols.xml
- cir transmit rawir -S sony15:12 -r 2 ??
- pcmak leading gap not decoded
- encoding toggle_bit_mask not used when popcount > 1
- compare against kernel encoder/decoder

Needed for release:
- Need ir-ctl and ir-keytable command line parsing
- man pages 
- rc_mapping() kfunc
- localization of cli messages
- shell completion

irp language oddities

DirecTV_3FG irp:{38k,600,msb}<1,-1|1,-2|2,-1|2,-2>(10,-2,(D:4,F:8,C:4,1,-30m,5,-2)*){C=7*(F:2:6)+5*(F:2:4)+3*(F:2:2)+(F:2)}[D:0..15,F:0..255]

encode with repeats: 0 -> not valid
decoder cannot generate down event with just non-repeating part, this would
not define D/F/C. So, decoder has to look at down part, see if it does not
define all required vars, and if not, add one iteration of repeat to
down decoder: very messy.
